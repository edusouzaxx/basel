 1. Residence permit
   
If you are staying for more than 3 months, you must have a valid work and/or residence permit. For citizens of EU-25*/EFTA states, a simplified permit procedure applies. You can apply for your work and residence permit directly at the registration office of your place of residence within 14 days after arrival and before beginning work. Required documentation includes a valid identity card or passport as well as a written letter of confirmation from an employer (e.g. work contract with stated duration of employment). Information at:  www.bfm.admin.ch. *For citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, admission restrictions apply. Further information can be found at: www.bfm.admin.ch > Topics > Free Movement of Persons Switzerland - EU/EFTA.

 2. House-hunting

Find your apartment on Switzerland’s biggest property market at www.comparis.ch/immobilien. You should bring the following documents to the viewing of a flat:

- Copy of residence permit / valid identification
- Copy of employment contract
- Former landlord details
- «Betreibungsauskunft» (extract from debt collection register): This is a legal Swiss document, which provides proof that you have paid all your bills on time. Information can be obtained at your local «Betreibungsamt» (Debt Collection Office)

 3. Taxes
 
 Foreign employees without a residence permit C pay withholding tax in Switzerland. A tax calculator is available at www.comparis.ch/quellensteuer.
 
 4. Social insurance and salaries


 Get information on all types of social insurances, salaries and ancillary wage costs at www.comparis.ch/umzug-schweiz
 
 5. Pension provision
 
 Ask your insurance company in your home country about the ideal solution for your pension provision in the case of a stay abroad or emigration.
 
 6. Health insurance
 
 You have to register with a Swiss health insurance within 3 months of entering the country. A premium comparison beforehand at http://www.comparis.ch/krankenkassen is worthwhile as the premiums for the mandatory basic insurance vary strongly – even though the benefits are required by law and therefore the same with all insurance companies.
 
 7. Accident insurance
 
 If you work 8 hours a week or more, you are automatically provided accident coverage by your employer. Otherwise, you have to get an accident insurance.
 
 8. Customs and entry regulations
 
 Before moving to Switzerland, you should read up on the customs regulations at http://www.ezv.admin.ch.

- Health insurance

- Phone, mobile phone, Internet and TV
- Newspapers and magazines
