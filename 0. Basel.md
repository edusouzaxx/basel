Required documentation includes a valid identity card or passport as well as a written letter of confirmation from an employer (e.g. work contract with stated duration of employment). Information at:  www.bfm.admin.ch. *For citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, admission restrictions apply. Further information can be found at: www.bfm.admin.ch > Topics > Free Movement of Persons Switzerland - EU/EFTA.

 2. House-hunting
