## 1. Everyday life

The canton of Basel-Stadt has a modern administration at its disposal which fosters uncomplicated dealings with the inhabitants.
The central institution for this contact is the Customer Centre of the Residential Registration Office, with a broad range of services on offer.

- **Energy and drinking water -** The canton of Basel-Stadt is supplied with energy and drinking water by the Industrielle Werke (IWB). So that your energy and water consumption can be paid for correctly, please notify the IWB of any move by one week beforehand at the latest.

- **Rented housing -** If you live in a rental house or apartment, your landlord is the contact person for most matters. In contrast with many other countries, in Switzerland the kitchens in rental accommodations are part of the basic equipment, and a common laundry is available to the tenants.

- **Shopping -** In Basel there are countless possibilities for shopping. Most businesses are open in the evening during the week until 6.30pm, some until 8pm. In the inner city most businesses close on Saturday at 5pm or 6pm, and in some outer districts somewhat earlier. On Sundays and public holidays you can shop in the railway stations, at many petrol stations and in a few selected grocery shops located over the whole city. If you want to shop across the border in the neighbouring countries, you must comply with the appropriate customs regulations, since Switzerland does not belong to the Europe an Union and certain goods are subject to customs duties when imported.
 
- **Eating out -** Restaurants in Basel and its surroundings enjoy a good reputation. They are varied and offer something for every taste: the choice ranges from the cosy neighbourhood pub to the gourmet temple with stars and an award-winning chef. And as far as the type of cui sine is concerned, the Basel region knows no borders: you can choose between regional dishes and gastronomic delicacies from all over the world.

- **Residential Registration Office -** The Residential Registration Office is also specifically the first con tact point for people who are moving to Basel and must deal with their residency status in the canton. It records the data concerning all Swiss and foreign inhabitants. This includes, for example, chang es in marital status, address changes, name changes, births and deaths. The Residential Registration Office gives advice to newcomers and issues certificates and confirmations. In addition information and forms from other cantonal departments can be obtained here. Pass ports and identity cards for Swiss citizens are issued by the pass port office. It also handles lost property and issues certifications and apostilles.

- **Permits -** Personal advice is offered at the contact points in the Residential Registration Office, at the motor vehicle inspection department and at the building and traffic department. In some cases permits from other offices can also be applied for there. Keeping animals As a rule keeping pets does not require a permit in the canton of Ba sel-Stadt (exception: potentially dangerous dogs). However, when crossing the border, vaccination rules and   /or special import regula tions apply to many animals. Various regulations concerning keep ing them must also be complied with. And all animals must be ac commodated and cared for in a manner appropriate to their species. In addition dogs must be registered or re-registered for taxation with the veterinary office and also with AMICUS, and must carry a micro chip.

- **Waste disposal -** Daily tasks include, for example, the disposal of waste materials. In the canton of Basel-Stadt household rubbish – which by the way is called “Hauskehricht” in Switzerland – is collected twice a week. What districts are served on what days of the week is noted on the waste disposal calendar, which is supplied once a year or can be obtained in the Customer Centre of the Residential Registration Of fice and at police stations. For your “Hauskehricht” you must use the official rubbish bags of the canton, so-called “Bebbi-Säcke”. You can buy them at the till in most grocery shops.

- **Radio and TV -** Radio and TV are subject to licence fees in Switzerland. It does not matter whether radio, television, computer, tablet or mobile phone are present or in use. Serafe has been tasked by the Confederation with collecting the licensing fees. The licensing fees are paid per household, not per device. Families, flat-sharing communities or couples who live in the same household pay the fees only once

## 2. Children, Youth and Families

The future plays a central role in Basel, where child- and familyfriendly policies are a matter of course in all sectors. Since 2013, Basel has held the Unicef “Child Friendly Community” award. With respect to daycare for pre-school children, Basel also plays a leading role based on the citizens’ right to daycare which is encoded in the constitution.

- **Child care -** In terms of childcare by non-family members, parents have the choice between a number of options, including daycare centres or day families. Facilities are available in all residential neighbourhoods.

- **Leisure -** In Basel, families, youth and children are also well catered for when it comes to leisure activities, with numerous local recreation areas offering attractive locations to linger. In summer, open-air swimming pools are very popular, while in winter, two ice rinks invite the population to turn a few rounds. Libraries, museums, children’s and youth theatres, local meeting points and children’s and youth centres offer a wide range of leisure activities. On top of this, Basel boasts numerous public playgrounds, parks and sports facilities.

- **Advice/counselling -** A network of private and public institutions supports and helps families, parents, adolescents and children tackle problems or emergencies. Among them are the children and youth service, the centre for early intervention, parent counselling, the family, couple and educational counselling and the youth councelling.

## 3. Education

The canton of Basel-Stadt has a modern, high-quality school system that meets the diverse needs of the children and young people living here. In Switzerland education and training are in principle the responsibility of the cantons.

- **Early promotion of German -** Children who do not speak any or hardly any German attend a playgroup with German language support or a German-speaking nursery school for at least three half days per week in the year be fore they start kindergarten to learn German in a playful way. This early promotion of German has been mandatory in Basel since 2013

- **Kindergarten, primary and secondary school -** Compulsory schooling comprises eleven years and is divided into the kindergarten, primary and secondary levels. Children attend kindergarten for two years, usually between the ages of five and seven. After that they attend primary school for six years. Here chil dren learn French starting in the third year and English starting in the fifth year. After primary school all pupils attend the three-year secondary school. Depending upon their performance in school the children are divided into three levels: A (general requirements), E (expanded requirements) and P (high requirements). Kindergarten and primary school offer day-care structures beyond the instruction: in exchange for a fee paid by the parents, children are looked after in day-care facilities at schools or for midday meals. During the school holidays there are supervision at school, day holidays, and sports camps for children. In secondary schools, the children also have the option of a lunchtime meal. In the afternoons, the children can attend supervised learning centres or recreational courses. In all schools core times are applied.

- **Apprenticeships, vocational and technical school certificates, academic secondary school -** Depending upon their performance in school and personal abilities and interests, after the eleven years of compulsory schooling young people have several possibilities. One of them is the two- to four year apprenticeship. A vocational school certificate during or after the apprenticeship opens the way to studies at a college of higher education. Further possibilities are the four-year Fachmaturitätsschule (vocational matriculation school) and the four-year secondary school. A diploma from a matriculation school entitles the holder to study at a college of advanced education, and the certificate from a secondary school leads to a university.

- **University of Basel -** The University of Basel is the oldest university in Switzerland. It was founded in 1460 and today it is a modern university located in the city centre with an attractive range of research, teaching and ser vices. As a traditional comprehensive university it covers almost all fields of study and includes seven faculties. By European standards the University of Basel is a rather small university. It counts 13,000 students, nearly 3000 of them are doctoral candidates. The propor tion of female students amounts around 55 per cent and a fifth of the students is from abroad. The University of Basel is held by the can tons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft. In Switzerland all univer sity students pay student fees; in Basel these amount to 850 francs per semester. The University of Basel offers a rich and diversified student life. In addition to the range of university sports, there are numerous associations and student bodies. The official representa tion of the students at the University of Basel is the “scuba”. This works not only for student participation, but also promotes student initiatives and organises its own cultural offerings.

- **University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW) -** In addition to the university, in the field of university-level education the FHNW provides a high-quality range of educational programmes. The FHNW is a regionally anchored educational institution with a international reputation. It includes ten schools, which cover the subjects of Computer Science, Engineering and Environment, Ar chitecture and Civil Engineering, Business, Life Sciences, Art and Design, Social Work, Teacher Education, Psychology and Music in teaching and applied research. The FHNW has almost 14,000 stu dents. 1,000 of them come from abroad. Female students make up just above 50 percent. Fees are 700 francs per semester for Swiss students and 1,000 Swiss francs for students from the EU/EFTA.

- **Private schools -** Those who don’t want to make use of the free public schools can make use of the services of a private educational institution in the Basel region. These include the English-, French- or Italian-speaking international schools in Basel and the surrounding area. At individu al private schools a leaving certificate recognised throughout Swit zerland can also be provided

- **Further education -** Basel also offers a wide choice in the area of further education: The FHNW offers a diversified range of further education possibilities in all its subject areas. Under the “Advanced Studies” the University of Basel for example organises academic further education courses to be completed while working. Federal qualifications in the field of higher vocational training can be obtained from public vocational colleges as well as private schools. The adult education centre of both Basel cantons offers numerous events in general further education, language courses and post-literacy courses for adults. And for all people who have reached the age of 58, the “SeniorenUni” organises events in various fields of knowledge of the University of Basel. Adults who had no opportunity in their youth to attend a sec ondary school can obtain a canton school-leaving certificate in the matriculation courses for working people (Maturitätskurse für Erwachsene [MfB]), which enables access to the University of Basel. In addition, adult education facilities offer vocational qualification courses for adults. 

## Culture
Where culture is concerned, Basel has more to offer than cities of
comparable size. This has to do with the city’s history, its location
and the cosmopolitanism of the city and its inhabitants.
12 13
Culture Culture
cultural festival “Floss”, which is performed on a raft in the Rhine in
the summer, represents a special feature. When world-famous stars
such as Rod Stewart, Seal or Alicia Keys come to Basel, they are
probably attending the BALOISE SESSION. Every autumn, top in
-
ternational stars perform at the popular Swiss boutique music fes
-
tival, leaving the audience with memorable experiences. Further
-
more, at the Musical Theatre Basel, one of the most modern stages
in Europe, major musical events regularly take place.
Cinema
In Basel film fans also get their money’s worth. The fact that films in
the cinema are shown in the original but with subtitles is considered
a special feature of Switzerland. Films for children and young peo
-
ple can, however, also be seen in a dubbed version. The choice
ranges from the great multiplex cinema to the small city cinema.
Architecture
The cityscape of Basel with its numerous contrasts and sights also
belongs to the culture of the city. On the one hand, Basel has very
well preserved old city parts with buildings from the 13th and 14th
centuries. Above all the cathedral hill, the suburb of St. Alban and
the streets between the market square and Petersplatz deserve a
mention. Besides that Basel offers first-class modern architecture
in a density offered by hardly any other European city. Among Ba
-
sel’s architectural highlights are the 105-metre-high Messe tower
by architects Morger Degelo Marques and the St. Jakob-Park foot
-
ball stadium by Herzog & de Meuron. The new Novartis Campus
next to the French border was realised with the participation of re
-
nowned architects. The 205 meter high Roche office tower in Klein
-
basel is the tallest office building in Switzerland. The first Roche
Tower, already completed in 2015, is 178 metres high. It is hardly
astonishing, therefore, that the Swiss Museum of Architecture is
also located in Basel.
Museums
The reputation of the Basel museums has made the city known
worldwide. The Basel Art Museum exhibits treasures by old mas
-
ters, among them Hans Holbein, as well as modern classics. The
integrated Haus für Gegenwartskunst houses an extensive con
-
temporary art collection. But this is not the only museum known far
beyond the borders of the country. Other magnets for the public are
the Foundation Beyeler in Riehen with its spectacular rotating exhi
-
bitions, the Museum of Antiquities, the Tinguely Museum and the
Museum of Cultures. One of Basel’s specialities is that the five public
museums cooperate closely with the numerous private museums,
and have issued a common Upper Rhine Museum Pass for the mu
-
seums of the three-countries area. With this pass you have unlim
-
ited entry to the permanent and special exhibitions of around 345
museums, castles and gardens in Germany, France (Alsace) and
north-western Switzerland, and can take up to five children under
the age of 18 free of charge.
Theatre
In addition to the numerous museums, the Basel Theatre is a pillar
of the cultural city of Basel. It is run as a three-section operation with
three stages at two sites, and offers numerous operas, plays and
ballet productions annually. The Basel Theatre has been honoured
several times as one of the best stages in the German-speaking
area. Numerous small and tiny stages complete the theatre and
dance offerings in Basel.
Among the many small theatres of the region there are several that
specialise in theatre productions for children and youth. English
-
speaking performances take place regularly in Basel, and in the
French Saint-Louis, the Théâtre La Coupole Saint-Louis is situated
directly in front of the city gates.
A central municipal location for the free contemporary theatre,
dance and performance scene as well as for concerts in the area of
popular musicis the Basel Kaserne (the old barracks). With its broad
range the Kaserne promotes exchanges between the artists, the
public and other art centres.
Music
The musical offering in Basel is extensive. For classical concerts the
city casino on Barfüsserplatz in the middle of the inner city is the
most important venue. This features not only outstanding local en
-
sembles like the Basel Symphony Orchestra, the Basel Sinfonietta
and the Basel Chamber Orchestra, but also world-famous interna
-
tional orchestras and soloists hold guest performances. In addition
numerous classical concerts such as those performed by the ba
-
roque orchestra and vocal ensemble La Cetra are being staged in
churches throughout the city.
There are several jazz clubs in Basel, such as “the bird’s eye jazz
club” and there is also a series of festivals featuring all styles, from
Dixie to Swing and avantgarde jazz. In the areas of Rock, Hip-Hop,
Techno and other contemporary musical trends, several pubs in Ba
-
sel and in the local area provide a varied and lively programme. The
14 15
Carnival
“Morgestraich”
The prelude to the “drey scheenschte Dääg” (“the three best days”)
comes in the form of the so-called “Morgestraich” at 4 in the morning on the Monday. Then all the city centre lights go out and Queen
Fasnacht picks up the torch in the city till Thursday. A traditional and
archaic-seeming tapestry of sound from innumerable piccolos and
drums pervades the town. With their wild and brightly coloured costumes the merry Fasnacht crowd roams through the narrow lanes of
the old town until dusk begins to fall. The only sources of light are
powerful hand-painted lanterns.
“Cortège”
On the Monday afternoon (and on Wednesday too) there is the great
procession, the “Cortège”, when hundreds of cliques, “Guggemusiken” and decorated floats pass through the streets of outer and inner Basel. In Basel “Guggemusiken” mean wind and percussion
groups, which can be described as a mix between Big Bands and
strange noise machines.
Fasnacht Tuesday
Tuesday traditionally belongs to the children, who make their way
through the town and suburbs in small groups (“Schissdrägzygli”).
In the evening on Münsterplatz the over two hundred lanterns that
had made their grand entrance at the Morgestraich can be admired
in peace. At the same time the Guggemusiken take over the inner
city acoustically with their concerts.
“Schnitzelbängg”
There is intense activity in the pubs over these three days. In socalled “Schnitzelbängg” – humorous, and sometimes sarcastic
mocking verses – in which the political and social events of the past
months are scoffed at and commented on.
Origin
Etymologically the Basel Fasnacht can be traced back to the Lent
fasting period, and the date is determined by the Christian feast
days: The Basel Fasnacht always takes place six weeks before
Easter, thus a week later than in the Catholic German-speaking area,
and the afternoons of the Monday and Wednesday are declared official public holidays in Basel.
Carnival
For three days once a year there’s a very special atmosphere in Basel: it’s the three days of the Basel Fasnacht (Carnival), always in the
week following Ash Wednesday.

Green areas
Leisure gardens
Those who don’t have a garden can rent a leisure garden. The canton rents out leisure gardens around the city.
Recreation zones
One can also find recreation at the “Birsköpfli” on the edge of the
city, where the little river Birs flows into the Rhine. Or a walk along
the Wiese, another tributary of the Rhine. In the surrounding woods
there are numerous open hearths for evening barbecues. In the vicinity of the Spalentor in the city centre the University of Basel has a
botanical garden with a Sukkulentenhaus (succulents greenhouse)
and the Viktoriahaus dating from 1898. In the “Merian Gärten” in
front of the city gates, visitors can enjoy an English landscape park,
a medicinal plant garden and the rhododendron valley. The RegioGrüngürtel (regional green belt) around Basel is the main green
artery for leisure and recreation. It is also the habitat of several thousand animal and plant types, including some very rare and threatened species.
Zoo and animal park
Basel’s zoological garden – “dr Zolli”, as it is called here – is Switzerland’s oldest animal park. It was founded in 1874, and today the
“Zolli” displays a blend of modern, animal-friendly facilities with
magnificent old buildings in a green oasis in the immediate proximity of the train station. In the recreation area of the same name is the
Lange Erlen animal park. This is smaller than the zoo and features
primarily domestic animals.
Ship and ferry
Boat trips on the Rhine are also very popular. The Basel passenger
boat company offers regular and special passenger trips throughout the year both near and beyond the city.
And if you just wish to cross the Rhine to the other bank, then you
should try one of the four ferries in Basel. These noiseless craft use
the currents of the Rhine to reach the other bank without additional
power. And besides, when one doesn’t quite believe something,
then one says in Basel: “Verzell doch das em Fäärimaa!” – Just tell
that to the ferryman!
Green areas
The canton of Basel-Stadt is indeed a city canton, but it offers in and
around the town a large number of green spaces, ranging from pocket parks in empty lots to the extensive city park on former graveyard
grounds.
18 19
Sport
Popular sport
 The possibilities for popular sport are virtually unlimited. More than
200 sports clubs are active in Basel, the list of sports on offer is long
and includes numerous water, ball, combat and track sports. And
every year there is also the car-free movement and experience day
“slowUp” in the Basel region.
 Those who prefer to keep fit on an individual basis can enjoy the city
and its surroundings by cycling, skating, inline skating, playing golf,
riding or paragliding. There’s also a wide choice indoors, from aquajogging to yoga. The public sports facilities in Basel are popular
public and family meeting points.
Youth development
Youth encouragement and development takes pride of place in
sport. Many clubs run their own junior sections. The canton, the municipalities and the Confederation support the sporting activities of
young people.
Basel as a sports city
Basel’s reputation as a sporting city is based on clubs such as the
Basel Football Club (FCB). The home games draw crowds averaging over 25,000 in the St. Jakob-Park (“Joggeli”). Basel also hosts
on an annual basis top-class sporting events such as the international tennis tournament Swiss Indoors, the Badminton Swiss Open
or the Longines CHI.
Sport
Sport has its place in all forms and facets of city life. Enthusiasts
can choose from a very wide range of individual and team sports,
as there are excellent facilities for both popular and competitive
sporting activities. A multitude of fitness offerings complete the
traditional sports opportunities in Basel.
20 21
Health
Health insurance
Compulsory health insurance covers the costs of treatment in the
event of illness, whereby the health insurance funds are organised
within the private sector and there is no state health insurance fund
in Switzerland. Basic insurance is compulsory for all inhabitants –
including for foreigners with residence permits – and various additional insurances can be taken out on a voluntary basis. However, in
the case of these additional services the health insurance funds are
free to decide whom they accept or do not accept in the insurance
plans. In the basic insurances, on the other hand, the funds may not
reject any application.
Hospitals
The University Hospital of Basel is one of the largest medical centres
in Switzerland with highly recognised international standards. The
doctors and nurses work on the basis of the latest scientific knowledge for the well-being, safety and recovery of the patients. Other
independent public and private hospitals also offer high-quality
medical care in all disciplines.
Children
In the field of healthcare children also have an important place in
Basel. The University Children’s Hospital of both Basels (UKBB) is
an autonomous university skills centre offering high-quality medicine in an environment designed for children. The School Dental
Clinic is a public institution that was founded in 1921 for the benefit
of the dental health of Basel children and young people. Already at
that time the idea was to open a dental clinic where all children of
the Canton of Basel-Stadt could be treated – irrespective of their
family’s financial situation.
Old age
Basel-Stadt has an extensive range of support services for the elderly. The Long-term Care Division of the Department of Health, as
the canton’s central information and specialist unit, is familiar with
and coordinates all the services on offer.
Health
The canton of Basel-Stadt guarantees the highest quality of medical
care for all its inhabitants due to a differentiated health system. The
basis for this is an insurance system that functions in a uniform manner throughout Switzerland.
22 23
Integration
Advice and contact points
Immigrants in Basel have at their disposal a comprehensive network
of advice and contact points. GGG Migration is the competence
centre for integration in Basel-Stadt. Its employees advise private individuals in over 17 languages on topics such as employment, residence, German courses, family, finances, health, social insurance,
or taxes. They mediate interactions with employers, authorities, and
institutions and offer guidance on matters related to integration and
migration. The Residential Registration Office is the contact point for
questions regarding residency and housing (registrations, notices
of departure, relocations, changes of tenancy, address information,
etc.) and permits and ID cards (passports, residence permits and
cross-border commuter permits, family residence permits, attestations, certificates).
Offerings
Among the many offerings is, for example, the event “Welcome to
Basel”. The executive council welcomes all new residents personally. Various authorities and associations provide information on topics such as employment, residence, education, health, or finances.
Additionally, new residents have the opportunity to get to know
each other and network among themselves. At the “Welcome to the
neighbourhood” event held every year, the district organisations inform the residents from the various districts about life and offerings
in their neighbourhood. The web platform “Hallo Basel-Stadt” also
provides initial information on the most important areas of life in 20
languages.
Languages and integration courses
An essential factor for integration is language. A broad range of language and integration courses is available in the canton so that all
those interested can find a suitable language course. During the
welcome meeting at the Residential Registration Office, new residents entitled to a residence permit B receive a voucher for a free
German course of 80 lessons. The voucher is valid for one year. All
residents of the canton of Basel-Stadt are also entitled to a reduced
course fee even after one year.
Integration
The residential and economic location of Basel-Stadt is characterised by its internationality and immigration. People from 160 countries live and work here, and practically every other marriage is between two nationalities. Everyone should feel comfortable and be
able to shape their lives independently and autonomously in this urban diversity. To this end Basel-Stadt pursues an active integration
and anti-discrimination policy that covers all aspects of life.
24 25
Economy and employment
Employment conditions
The first two or three months of employment are usually considered
as a trial with a notice period varying from a few days to a maximum
of two weeks. After attaining permanent employment status the notice period is increased to between one and six months. Working
hours are between 40 and 42.5 hours per week with at least 4 weeks
paid vacation per year. Salaries are generally paid on a monthly basis. A 13th month salary is common and often established by law. In
many companies it is usual to award a discretionary bonus when
business is good.
Work permits
People from the EU and EFTA countries benefit from the free movement of people agreements: short-term working visits only have to
be reported. A work or residence permit is required for visits lasting
more than three months; these can be applied for at the Customer
service centre for Migration and Population Services.
Special rules for admission to the labour market apply to individuals
from countries that are not members of the EU or EFTA. The employer has to submit their application for a work permit to the cantonal
authorities. The approval of the State Secretariat for Migration in
Bern is also required.
Social security
Whoever works in Switzerland is subject to the Swiss system of social security. This applies both to Swiss and foreigners. Even those
who are not working are subject to the same system of social security in many areas. Basically every person is insured individually
in Switzerland. For this, contributions must be made that entitle the
person to corresponding benefits. Switzerland has a close-knit network of social insurances which includes unemployment insurance,
family allowances, protection against the consequences of illness
and accident, and loss of income due to maternity.
Old age/ retirement provisions
Retirement provisions are based on three pillars: the first pillar, oldage, survivors’ and disability insurance (AHV/IV) is a general public insurance, serving to secure subsistence. The second pillar refers in Switzerland to occupational pensions (BV). Together with the
first pillar, it is intended to safeguard the continuation of one’s habitual standard of living. Finally the third pillar consists of individual
voluntary pension provisions.
Economy and
employment
The Basel economic region is among the most productive and innovative in the world. Within Switzerland Basel is the region with the
greatest economic momentum.
About 200,000 people from Switzerland and the surrounding areas
work here. Behind this success lie the knowledge-based industries.
These include in particular the life sciences sector with large pharmaceutical companies and biomedical research that have traditionally been very strong in Basel.
26 27
Fairs and markets
Autumn fair
The high point of Basel’s fair calendar is the Autumn Fair. “D’Mäss”,
as the Baslers call this event, begins two weeks before Martinstag
(Martin’s day) and is heralded on the opening Saturday at noon precisely by the fair bells of St Martin’s Church. It ends on the third following Sunday. Breathtaking rides, traditional stalls and nostalgic
attractions excite visitors at seven locations.
City and weekly markets
The city market on the Marktplatz (market square) is a highly colourful event where an abundance of delicacies and specialities are on
offer. These include vegetables and fruits, flowers, meat products,
mushrooms, honey, wine, coffee, dry goods, breads and handmade
products, tea and much more. The city market takes place from
Tuesday through Wednesday until 2pm and Friday and Saturday until 6pm. The “Schlemmer-Markt” is a gourmet market held at Marktplatz every Monday and offers a wide variety of delicious foods and
beverages. Numerous other markets are held in the districts, creating a friendly atmosphere with quality, freshness and customer
proximity. Market stalls selling fresh produce and delicious menus
lure shoppers in under the great dome of the old market hall at the
railway station. The market hall is open every day, but what is on offer
varies depending on the time of day and which day of the week it is.
The new goods market on Barfüsserplatz in the city centre offers
every Thursday all kinds of ware: jewellery, arts and crafts from
around the world, decorations, gourmet food and clothes are just a
few examples. There’s also plenty of choice of food and drink.
Flea markets
The flea market on Petersplatz is a popular meeting place on Saturdays for everyone who likes second-hand goods. From fine antiques to overalls, here one can find everything one needs for daily
life – at very attractive prices. In the middle of the square children
can sell their toys free of charge. And twice a month during the
week there’s the Wednesday flea market on Barfüsserplatz with a
wide variety of rare objects and treasures. And a number of flea
markets set up by individuals for individuals take place throughout
the year in different districts of Basel.
Christmas market
In December Basel turns into a Christmas city: the great Christmas
market is set up on Barfüsserplatz and Münsterplatz. From mulled
wine to ice trees, arts and crafts to Christmas tree decorations, children’s toys to seasonal delicacies, there’s something for everyone.
In addition there’s a children’s programme with handicraft workshops and candle-making.
Fairs and markets
In the year 1471 the city of Basel was granted the right to hold fairs.
The city thus has a centuries-old tradition, and today Basel is a popular fair and congress venue with its top-class cultural and hotel
offerings.
28 29
Mobility
On foot
There are about 100 strolling zones – where pedestrians have right
of way over all road vehicles – and far-reaching 30 km/h zones,
which make walking in Basel a pleasant and safe experience. Pedestrian zones in the city centre also make an important contribution
to an attractive network of walking paths.
By bicycle
Basel is a cycle-friendly town with a bicycle network that runs
through the whole region (red signs). Thanks to the bike rental systems Velospot and Pick-e-Bike, bicycles and e-bikes can be easily
rented. Cargo bikes and e-scooters can be rented from other providers.
Public Transport
Basel has an extensive, cross-border public transport network that
boasts numerous connections and reliable punctuality. The train
stations of Basel SBB and the Badischer Bahnhof connect Basel
with the national and international long-distance and regional lines.
The inexpensive “Umweltabonnement”, a monthly environmentallyfriendly travel card, covers all means of public transport as bus,

By car
You must buy a parking ticket if you want to park on public property
in the town. Local residents can obtain a parking card, which allows
them to park on blue marked parking areas in their neighbourhood
without any time restrictions. Visitors arriving by car can obtain halfday or day parking tickets from public transport ticket machines or
on the Internet. Before travelling on a motorway, you must purchase
a toll sticker, which is valid for one calendar year. Thanks to the
large, nationwide car-sharing company Mobility, it is possible to do
without owning a car.
Mobility
The Canton of Basel-Stadt has an excellent infrastructure for all
modes of transport. Basel places a great deal of importance on
road users being able to travel in harmony. In Basel, it is easy to
travel in an environmentally friendly way thanks to dense and
well-developed networks of walking and cycling paths, as well as
a comprehensive and comfortable public transport system.

Politics
Switzerland has a federal structure and so the cantons have a
relatively great freedom of action. Each canton has its own constitution, own laws and courts, and it is the cantons that raise
direct taxes. In addition there is the principle: what is not expressly
stated in the Federal constitution as a Federal competence falls
under the competence of the cantons. However, the autonomy of
the cantons has limits. Where a Federal law exists it takes precedence over cantonal law.
As in every democratic system the political system of the Canton of Basel-Stadt is characterised by the interplay and opposing forces of parliament and government. A central element is also
the participation of the population and of parties and associations
in the political and legislative process.
City and communes
With its 37 square kilometres and about 200,000 inhabitants the
canton of Basel-Stadt is the smallest canton in Switzerland. It consists of the city of Basel and the rural communes of Riehen and Bettingen, which possess autonomy as communes and are thus entitled to manage their own affairs.
Cantonal Parliament
As a Swiss rarity the Great Council, the Basel Cantonal Parliament,
is also responsible for the communal affairs of the city of Basel. The
Great Council consists of 100 members and is re-elected every four
years. It sits twice a month in the Basel Town Hall in public sessions.
Executive Council
The executive council consists of seven members with equal rights,
who are elected for four-year terms. The President of the Executive
Council has representative duties and presides over the Department of Presidential Affairs, the other six government members
each head up one of the specialised departments. On the cantonal
level a department can be compared to a “Dezernat”; the departments on Federal level correspond to ministries.
States councillors and national councillors
On the Federal level Switzerland has a Parliament, consisting of two
chambers: the Council of States represents the cantons, the National Council the whole population. In the States Council each canton
has two representatives, in the National Council each canton is represented in function of its population. As a half-canton Basel-Stadt
has one States Councillor. In the National Council Basel-Stadt is represented by four delegates.
People’s rights
Swiss citizens over 18 years of age have the right to vote: they can
elect representatives to Parliament on the communal, cantonal and
national level and can also stand for election themselves. The governments of the Canton and the communes of Riehen and Bettingen are also elected by the population. The right to vote also gives
the Swiss the possibility of expressing themselves on whether or not
they agree with new laws. Furthermore they can themselves propose changes to the law through the right to initiate legislation and
bring it to a vote. Through the right to a referendum a popular vote
can be required on parliamentary decisions after they have been
taken. By means of a petition, people can file a request, suggestion
or complaint in writing to any regulatory or enforcing authority, irrespective of their voting right status – i.e. this includes foreigners and
children.
